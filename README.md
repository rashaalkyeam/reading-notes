### What HTML mean?

##### Hypertext Markup Language,is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.
- ### Some tages use in HTML:
   - Headers & Footers:
     ##The <header> and <footer>
      elements can be used for:
        * The main header or footer 
        that appears at the top or 
        bottom of every page on the 
        site.
        * A header or footer for an 
        individual <article or 
        <section> within the page.
  - Articles:
        The <article> element acts as 
        a container for any section of a 
        page that could stand alone and 
        potentially be syndicated.
  - Sections:
        The <section> element groups 
        related content together, and 
        typically each section would 
        have its own heading.

  - Figures:
        You already met the <figure>
      element in Chapter 5 when we 
      looked at images. It can be used 
      to contain any content that is 
      referenced from the main flow of 
      an article (not just images).
